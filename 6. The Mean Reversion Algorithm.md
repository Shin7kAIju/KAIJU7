6. The Mean Reversion Algorithm
Stock Screening :

Identify oversold (RSI < 30)/overbought (RSI > 70) stocks.
Filter using Z-score: (Price - 20d MA)/StdDev < -2.
Entry/Exit :
Enter when price touches lower Bollinger Band + positive divergence.
Exit at median regression (50% retracement).
Risk Management :
Stop-loss at 1.5Ã— StdDev from entry.
Volatility-scaled lot sizes using VIX term structure.
ML Enhancement :
Bayesian structural time series to estimate regime probabilities.
Attention mechanisms to weight multiple mean reversion signals.
Deployment :
Host on GCP with GPU-accelerated backtesting.
Use Airflow for daily Z-score recomputation.

from ta.momentum import RSIIndicator

def mean_reversion_strategy(data):
    rsi = RSIIndicator(close=data['Close'], window=14)
    data['RSI'] = rsi.rsi()
    data['ZScore'] = (data['Close'] - data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()) / data['Close'].rolling(window=20).std()

    # Entry/Exit Signals
    data['Signal'] = 0
    data.loc[(data['ZScore'] < -2) & (data['RSI'] < 30), 'Signal'] = 1  # Oversold
    data.loc[(data['ZScore'] > 2) & (data['RSI'] > 70), 'Signal'] = -1  # Overbought
    return data

# Example Usage
data = pd.read_csv('stock_data.csv')
processed_data = mean_reversion_strategy(data)
