7. The Market Maker Algorithm
Stock Screening :

Select top 100 SPY components by ADV (Average Daily Volume).
Filter for tight spreads (< 3bps) and low adverse selection risk.
Pricing :
Bid-ask spread = 1.5× realized volatility + inventory skew.
Hedge delta exposure using E-mini futures.
Risk Management :
Maximum net gamma exposure: ±$50k per stock.
Fat-tailed Value-at-Risk (VaR) model with EVT (Extreme Value Theory).
ML Enhancement :
Deep Reinforcement Learning for optimal inventory control.
GARCH models for volatility forecasting in spread calculation.
Deployment :
Bare-metal servers with Solarflare NICs for kernel bypass.
FIX/ITCH protocol handlers for direct exchange connectivity.

def market_maker_pricing(order_book, realized_volatility):
    spread = 1.5 * realized_volatility
    bid = order_book['mid_price'] - spread / 2
    ask = order_book['mid_price'] + spread / 2
    return bid, ask

# Example Usage
order_book = {'mid_price': 100, 'realized_volatility': 0.01}
bid, ask = market_maker_pricing(order_book, order_book['realized_volatility'])

Deployment
Hardware : Bare-metal servers with Solarflare NICs.
Protocol : FIX/ITCH handlers for direct exchange connectivity.
