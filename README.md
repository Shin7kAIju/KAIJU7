Welcome to **Kaiju Capital**, an open-source initiative aimed at building a state-of-the-art systematic trading framework powered by advanced machine learning (ML) and algorithmic strategies. This repository contains the implementation of seven cutting-edge trading algorithms designed for automated execution, coupled with institutional-grade risk management and portfolio optimization techniques.

Our goal is to create a robust, scalable, and commercially deployable trading system that combines traditional quantitative finance methodologies with modern ML innovations. Whether you're a developer, researcher, or hedge fund manager, this project is designed to inspire and empower you to build next-generation trading systems.

## **Overview**

Kaiju Capital is a systematic trading framework inspired by industry leaders like Marcos Lopez de Prado (author of *Advances in Financial Machine Learning*) and Jim Simons (founder of Renaissance Technologies). The project focuses on implementing seven core trading algorithms, each tailored for specific market conditions and asset classes. These algorithms are designed to be:

- **Data-driven**: Leverage historical and real-time data for decision-making.
- **Scalable**: Deployable across multiple exchanges and asset classes.
- **Compliant**: Adheres to regulatory standards such as FINRA Rule 15c3-5 and SEC Reg SCI.
- **Explainable**: Incorporates interpretable ML models and explainability tools like SHAP.

This repository serves as a foundation for building a hedge fund-level trading infrastructure, complete with backtesting, live deployment, and monitoring capabilities.

## **Algorithms**

Below is a summary of the seven algorithms implemented in this project:

| Algorithm                  | Core Idea                          | Key Indicators               | ML Component                 | Risk Management                 |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **1. Turtle Trending**     | Momentum breakout                 | 20d High, ATR               | LSTM volatility prediction   | ATR trailing stop, sector caps  |
| **2. Order Book Stalking** | Latency arbitrage                  | Order flow imbalance         | CNN toxic flow detection     | Microsecond circuit breakers    |
| **3. Engulfing**           | Candlestick reversal               | RSI, engulfing volume        | Transformer pattern scoring  | Fixed fractional sizing         |
| **4. Breakout**            | Consolidation breakout             | Bollinger Band width         | XGBoost success classifier   | Volatility-adjusted sizing      |
| **5. Correlation**         | Pairs trading                     | Cointegration z-score        | GNN correlation clusters     | Black-Litterman constraints     |
| **6. Mean Reversion**      | Oversold bounce                   | Bollinger Band, Z-score      | Bayesian regime detection    | VIX-scaled sizing               |
| **7. Market Maker**        | Spread capture                    | Realized volatility          | DRL inventory control        | EVT VaR, gamma limits           |

Each algorithm is modular, allowing for independent testing, optimization, and deployment.
