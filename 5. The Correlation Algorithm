5. The Correlation Algorithm
Stock Screening :

Find pairs with 1-year rolling correlation > 0.85 (energy sector, FX crosses).
Validate cointegration via Engle-Granger test (p < 0.05).
Entry/Exit :
Enter when z-score of spread > 2σ; exit at mean reversion.
Stop-loss at 3.5σ with Kalman filter adaptation.
Risk Management :
Half-life decay factor for dynamic position sizing.
Black-Litterman model for portfolio constraints.
ML Enhancement :
Graph Neural Networks to map cross-asset correlation clusters.
Federated learning to update correlation matrices across brokers.
Deployment :
Deploy correlation matrix updates via Apache Kafka streams.
Use Qdrant vector DB for fast similarity searches.

from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import coint
import numpy as np

def pairs_trading(stock1, stock2):
    score, pvalue, _ = coint(stock1['Close'], stock2['Close'])
    if pvalue < 0.05:  # Cointegrated
        spread = stock1['Close'] - stock2['Close']
        zscore = (spread - spread.mean()) / spread.std()
        return zscore
    return None

# Example Usage
stock1 = pd.read_csv('stock1.csv')
stock2 = pd.read_csv('stock2.csv')
zscore = pairs_trading(stock1, stock2)

Deployment
Streaming : Use Apache Kafka for correlation matrix updates.
Search : Qdrant vector DB for fast similarity searches.
