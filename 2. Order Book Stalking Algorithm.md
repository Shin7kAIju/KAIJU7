2. Order Book Stalking Algorithm
Stock Screening :

Focus on S&P 500 stocks with bid-ask spread < 0.05% (high liquidity).
Monitor Level 2 data for iceberg orders using volume clustering detection.
Entry/Exit :
Detect hidden orders via order flow imbalance (OFI) calculations.
Front-run large orders using Bayesian change-point detection.
Risk Management :
Microsecond-level circuit breaker if adverse selection > 0.1%.
Maximum inventory holding time: 5 minutes.
ML Enhancement :
CNN to classify order book heatmaps for toxic vs. benign flow.
Reinforcement Learning for optimal bid-ask placement.
Deployment :
Colocate servers in NY4/NASDAQ data centers.
Use FPGA acceleration for order book parsing.

from scipy.stats import bayes_mvs
import numpy as np

def detect_hidden_orders(order_book):
    bids = np.array([order[1] for order in order_book['bids']])
    asks = np.array([order[1] for order in order_book['asks']])

    # Bayesian Change Point Detection
    bid_mean, _, _ = bayes_mvs(bids, alpha=0.95)
    ask_mean, _, _ = bayes_mvs(asks, alpha=0.95)

    if abs(bid_mean.statistic - ask_mean.statistic) > threshold:
        return "Hidden Order Detected"
    return "No Hidden Order"

# Example Usage
order_book = {'bids': [[price, volume]], 'asks': [[price, volume]]}  # Replace with real data
result = detect_hidden_orders(order_book)

Deployment
Colocation : Place servers in NY4/NASDAQ data centers.
Hardware Acceleration : Use FPGA for ultra-low latency.
